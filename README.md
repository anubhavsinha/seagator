Seagator is a search aggregator written in Python.  
It is  designed to be your ultimate search alligator,  
without losing out on any personlized relevance ranking.  

It is conceptualised on the premise that, all the major search engines have quite a bit of difference  
in there results, which comes up because of the inherent difference in their relevance ranking algoritms.  

Most of the times you search Google, without even realizing that, you are missing out on some of the other  
good potential results, which are among the top 10, according to some other state-of-the-art  
algorithm.
